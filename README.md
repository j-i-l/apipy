#pyAPI

This is a tiny python package intended to easy the interaction with api's of various sites.

Originally it was just a part of a small python based trader for the page www.cryptsy.com but I decided to isolate the part for further use with other sites similar to this one (eg. bte-c.com, mtgox.com, ...)

##Status

The package is under development, so don't expect it to work for now.

For now, public requests work fine and private request that take a key and a secret pair also execute correctly.

There will also be a command line tool that allows to directly run requests.

##Install

To come...

    pyhton setup.py install #as usual
    
##Usage
